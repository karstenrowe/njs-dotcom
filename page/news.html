						<h3>A few kind words ...<span>20 Jan, 2014</span></h3>
						<blockquote>Nicola treats my dressage pony on a regular basis. On her last treatment, she found an area of tension in her saddle area. After getting the saddle fitter out, we found the padding was much less on this side, and all fell in to place. Without the treatment she would have a sore back. Thanks Nicola.<cite>Nicola Bellamy</cite></blockquote>

						<h3>A few kind words ...<span>18 Oct, 2013</span></h3>
						<blockquote>I have been very impressed by the way Nicola has treated my horse. I appreciated the time she spent initially thoroughly investigating and understanding Richie's problems. She dealt with both me and the horse in a professional yet sympathetic manner and her concern for the welfare of the horse was apparent. Nicola impressed me with her detailed perception and treatment of problems and over the course of treatments Richie became noticeably more comfortable and happier in his ridden work. I am happy to recommend Nicola and look forward to her continuing to treat my horse in the future.<cite>Monica Dossett</cite></blockquote>

						<blockquote>My older horse received treatment from Nicola to relieve tension in his neck and back. I can already see a major improvement after the first treatment. The continuing treatment will involve Deep Oscillation therapy to help with his arthritic condition in his shoulders. I look forward to working with her in the near future to continuing to bring my horse back into full, comfortable work.<cite>Amy Wise</cite></blockquote>

						<blockquote>Zak initially started massage treatments due to bucking and tail swishing when mounted. Nicola suggested that the saddle may be too tight and was causing tension in his back. Once this was changed, and from another treatment, he is much happier in his ridden work and performance has improved greatly. I am very pleased with his progress and would happily recommend her.<cite>Barbara Holt</cite></blockquote>
